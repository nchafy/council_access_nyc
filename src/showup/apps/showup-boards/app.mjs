/* Community boards — the 59 boards, how to reach one, and when it meets.
 *
 * Ported from the `/board/` index and the 59 board pages, the same way the councils program
 * was: the list and the facts were two routes and are now two panes.
 *
 * Three artifacts, because a board's answer comes from three places. `lookup.json` has the
 * names and what each board covers. `preview.json` has the office, the phone, the cadence in
 * the board's own words, the covering council districts and the budget requests.
 * `board-meetings.json` has each board's own calendar, with when it was fetched and how
 * stale it is — which matters more here than anywhere else on the site, because the City runs
 * no board meeting calendar and these are the boards' own feeds.
 *
 * What the old pages had and this does not yet: the board's email and website, its public
 * members, and the prose on what a board can and cannot do. The first two are in the build's
 * board records but not in `preview.json`; naming that is better than letting it look
 * complete.
