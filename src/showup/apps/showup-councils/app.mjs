/* City councils — the 51 Council districts, and who represents each.
 *
 * Ported from the `/district/` index and the 51 district pages. The list and the facts were
 * two routes; here they are two panes of one window, which is what makes the 51 pages a
 * program rather than 51 programs.
 *
 * The facts come from `preview.json`, which the build already writes for the map's panel.
 * It carries the member, the committees, the participatory-budgeting cycle and the covering
 * community boards. What the old pages had and this does not yet: the testimony guidance and
 * the citywide meeting shortlist. Both are prose and a citywide artifact rather than
 * per-district facts, and neither is in that file — so they are named here as missing rather
 * than quietly dropped.
