/* Map — the 51 council districts and the 59 community boards, drawn.
 *
 * Ported from this site's own `/map/` route. What changed is the page it assumed, which is
 * the lesson `webxp`'s `docs/apps.md` records from porting the base map: the route shipped a
 * title bar, a taskbar, a status bar and a sliding detail panel, and the desktop is all four
 * of those now. Selecting a district used to open a panel and offer a link to
 * `/district/35/`; it fills a card in this window instead, because that route is going away
 * and a program is not a page.
 *
 * MapLibre and the base map are NOT vendored in this folder. They are already shipped at
 * `/vendor/`, fetched and verified against a pinned sha256 by `scripts/fetch_maplibre.py`
 * and `scripts/fetch_basemap.py`. `docs/apps.md` says to vendor a dependency that is the
 * app's alone and to point at a shared path when it is not: a second copy here would be a
 * second thing to pin and the checksums would have to agree by hand.
 *
 * `singleton: true` is load-bearing rather than a preference. The vendored `basemap.mjs`
 * finds its own controls with `document.getElementById` — `map-status`, `map-zoom-in`,
 * `map-zoom-out`, `map-attrib`, and every `[data-basemap]` button — and it is pinned, so it
 * cannot be scoped from here. One window means those ids are unique in the document and the
 * lookups resolve to this app's elements. A second window would drive the first one's map.
 * Everything this file looks up itself is scoped to the subtree it built.

 * non-zero camera padding, and panning the centroid rather than the bounding box. That page,
 * the panel and the three pins were all deleted on 2026-11-08, and this program never
 * carried the behaviour.
 *
 * That is deliberate, and it was checked rather than assumed. The pan existed because the
 * panel slid in *after* the click and could land on top of the place the reader had just
 * pressed. The facts card cannot do that: it is already on screen in a fixed place before
 * any selection — measured at canvas x 8–392, y 157–291 of an 818x507 map — and it takes the
 * pointer (`.map-cards > * { pointer-events: auto }`), so a click inside its box never
 * reaches the map in the first place. The point a reader presses is therefore always one
 * they can still see, which is the whole of what the pan was for.
 *
 * A pan written for the old reason was tried here first and measured as unreachable: its
 * trigger is a click behind the card, and the card consumes those clicks.
 *
 * What is *not* preserved: part of a selected district's highlight can sit behind the card.
 * That is a different complaint from the one the pins were about, and the fill is not what
 * the reader is reading — the card over it carries the facts.
