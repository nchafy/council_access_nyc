/* Show Up NYC — the folder.
 *
 * webxp draws a desktop and a taskbar but has no folder container: a program is an icon, and
 * an icon opens a window. So this is the folder, in the only way the shell affords one — a
 * window whose contents are the four programs, each of which opens in a window of its own.
 * That is what a folder on an XP desktop does, and `desktop.launch(id)` is the double click.
 *
 * It is the only thing on the desktop. The four programs it contains are deliberately NOT
 * `onDesktop`, so the desktop stays one icon rather than five and the folder means something.
